    "In this module, you will learn the basics of the Python programming language. While Python is a complete language with lots of functionality, the reality is that you need relatively little code to **do** AI. You should be set to get started with the basics covered in these modules. We will add additional Python sections to introduce more information later, but this should get you well on your way!\n",

    "### After this module, students will be able to:\n",
    "* Define what a variable is, and use the basic Python operators.\n",
    "* Recognize the importance of a consistent coding style, and describe best practices for variable naming.\n",
    "* Analyze Python error messages related to creating variables, and identify corrective action to fix them.\n",
    "* Describe the various Python data types, and convert a variable to another data type.\n",
    "* Use import statements to access library functions.\n",

    "1. This file is a **Jupyter Notebook**. It combines `text cells` and `code cells` and is helpful as a hybrid didactic/experiential learning environment. In practice, Jupyter notebooks are often used for rapid code prototyping or communicating code and results understandably.\n",

    "    1. Select (click) the cell, and click the ‚ñ∂Ô∏è button at the top of the notebook to execute the code.\n",
    "    2. Select the cell, and press `Control + Enter` (on Mac, `Command + Enter`)\n",

    "4. To add a new cell, either click the `+` in the top toolbar or click the insert before or after buttons in the cell's toolbar.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  Use the dropdown to select if the cell is a Code, Markdown, or Raw cell.\n",

    "6. To delete an entire cell, select the cell and either click the scissors icon in the top toolbar or click the üóëÔ∏è button in the cell's toolbar. "

    "The list `my_list` has four elements, two of which are integers; one is a floating point number, and the last is a string. This demonstrates an important feature of Python lists: lists can contain elements with different types!\n",

    "This can be handy--it may make your life easier in accomplishing your task. But comes at a cost in terms of speed and memory, which is one reason lists are used less in AI, at least for storing data. \n",

    "List elements are accessed using their index (or position in the list).\n",
