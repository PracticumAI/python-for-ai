    "\n",
    "Much of the text and code in this notebook comes from the [Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/) lesson [\"Making Plots With plotnine\"](https://datacarpentry.org/python-ecology-lesson/07-visualization-ggplot-python.html).

    "## Grammar of Graphics\n",
    "\n",
    "As noted on the [`plotnine` website](https://plotnine.readthedocs.io/):\n",
    "\n",
    "> plotnine is an implementation of a grammar of graphics in Python based on ggplot2.\n",
    "> The grammar allows you to compose plots by explicitly mapping variables in a\n",
    "> dataframe to the visual objects that make up the plot.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Plotting with a grammar of graphics is powerful. Custom (and otherwise complex) \n",
    "> plots are easy to think about and build incremently [sic], while the simple plots \n",
    "> remain simple to create.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/gramar_of_graphics_thumbnail.png\" align='right'> The Grammar of Graphics concept originated with Leland Wilkinson's [book by that name](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/0-387-28695-0), first published in 1999. The popular [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/) package [`ggplot`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) was created by Hadley Wickham in 2005 as an implementation of Wilkinson's concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *Towards Data Science* article [Data Visualization — Grammar of Graphics](https://medium.com/aiskunks/data-visualization-grammar-of-graphics-fccf78379b52) by Swathi Sharma provides a good explanation of the tenets and structure of the Grammar of Graphics:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### Grammar vs Grammar of Graphics\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Grammar is described as a system of rules that aids in the definition and establishment\n",
    "> of language components.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Grammar of Graphics is a framework that allows us to explain the components of any visual \n",
    "> in a straightforward manner. Instead of random trials and errors, it employs a layered technique\n",
    "> that use predetermined components to build a visualization\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Grammar of Graphics is a theory developed by Leland Wilkinson for visualizing and communicating\n",
    "> data in a structured and coherent way. The Grammar of Graphics consists of a set of principles \n",
    "> and rules that guide the design of graphics for data visualization.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The Grammar of Graphics is based on the idea that every graphic can be broken down into a series \n",
    "> of components or layers. These components include the data, the aesthetic mapping, the geometric \n",
    "> shapes, the statistical transformation, and the scales.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> The data component refers to the raw data that is being visualized, while the aesthetic mapping \n",
    "> refers to the way that data is mapped to visual properties such as color, size, and shape. The geometric\n",
    "> shapes component refers to the basic visual elements used to represent the data, such as points, lines, \n",
    "> and bars. The statistical transformation component refers to any calculations or analyses performed on \n",
    "> the data, such as aggregations or summaries. Finally, the scales component refers to the way that data \n",
    "> is transformed to fit within the visual space, such as scaling the axis.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> By breaking down graphics into these components, the Grammar of Graphics provides a systematic approach \n",
    "> to designing and interpreting data visualizations. It allows for greater flexibility in visualizing data,\n",
    "> as well as a standardized way of communicating the design choices made in the creation of a graphic.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> A variant of this, is known as the layered grammar of graphics framework, proposed by Hadley Wickham, \n",

    "## `plotnine` provides an API for plotting\n",
    "\n",
    "An API, or Application Programming Interface, defines how two or more programs can communicate with eachother. `plotnine` is an API that communicates with `matplotlib`, the primary Python plotting library. Essentially, `plotnine` implements the Grammar of Graphics syntax and translates your `plotnine` commands into `matplotlib` code to create your graphics.\n",
    "\n",
    "This may be our first encounter with APIs, but it will certainly not be our last--much of the code used in AI applications is using one or more APIs to communicate with other libraries to implement the tasks we want to accomplish.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Let's get plotting!\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as with the other packages, `plotnine` needs to be imported. It is good practice to not just load an entire package, such as `from plotnine import *`, but to use an abbreviation as we used `pd` for Pandas."
