    "1. With the rapid development of AI frameworks, it is common that functions are renamed, moved, replaced, or modified in other ways. In most cases, the developers will warn you that this is happening in the future and start issuing what are called **deprecation** warnings--something that is deprecated is being phased out and will, at some point, stop working. Take note of these warnings, especially if you are developing code you hope to use for a while. Changing to the new name/function/way of calling the feature now may save you trouble in the future. But, despite the warning, the function will still work for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * In the example below, the deprecated function wasn't even called in our code but by a function we called. In this case, you can try updating the package or ignore it for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ![Screenshot of a deprecation warning](images/deprecation_warning.png)\n",
    "  \n",
    "   * The deprecation warning reads, \"The rowNum attribute was deprecated in Matplotlib 3.2 and will be removed two minor releases later. Use ax.get_subplotspec().rowspan.start instead.\" This means the `rowNum` parameter is being phased out and will not be supported after Matplotlib 3.4 (two minor versions later). A replacement is also suggested.\n"

    "2. Another common source of red output that can be ignored is when using GPUs (remember that's the Graphics Processing Unit used for much of the AI calculations).

    "> This tends not to be an issue on **Google Colab** as each notebook runs within its own environment. However, the free account limits you to one concurrent session at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another class of error that you may encounter in working through notebooks, either in this course or in your development, is a CUDA out-of-memory error. CUDA is the programming language that interfaces with the GPU. When things work well, the error is relatively straightforward, e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "![CUDA out of memory error](https://github.com/PracticumAI/python-for-ai/blob/main/images/CUDA_OOM.png?raw=true)\n",

    "When things don't work well, the error can be more cryptic, and it can be hard to understand what went wrong. \n",

    "> The Python libraries we use work behind the scenes to communicate with CUDA, so you don't need to worry about it much. But when you see CUDA, know that it means something to do with a GPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "The source of the issue is that because there is time spent in moving data from the CPU memory (the computer's main RAM chips) to the GPU memory (the much more limited RAM built into the GPU itself), Python tries to minimize data movement. While notebooks are pretty good at managing the memory within a single notebook, a notebook will attempt to keep its memory on the GPU and not let other notebooks use the GPU RAM. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, if you have multiple notebooks open in a session, it is common to have odd errors caused by out-of-memory (OOM) situations. In many cases, Python recognizes and reports the error, but sometimes, hard-to-diagnose errors are displayed. In general, especially in our course notebooks, when you get an error, especially one using the GPU, suspect that there may be an out-of-memory error.\n",
